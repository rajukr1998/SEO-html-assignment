A favicon, also known as a website icon or a bookmark icon, is a small image that is associated with a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser tab next to the page's title, and it can also be used in bookmarks and other places where websites are listed.
Favicons are typically square images, but they can also be rectangular or circular. They are typically 16x16 pixels in size, but they can also be 32x32 or 64x64 pixels. Favicons can be any image format, but the most common formats are .ico and .png.
To add a favicon to your website, you need to upload the image to your website's server and then add the following code to the <head> section of your website's HTML code
Ex-<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
